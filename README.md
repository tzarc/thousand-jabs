# Thousand Jabs

In-game World of Warcraft ability prediction based off the official simulationcraft action priority lists; this addon creates rotation icons on the screen for abilities to be used based on current game state, and predicts subsequent ability usage based on cooldown availability and resource regeneration.

If you're interested in doing some WoW addon development and would like to take over a class module, you can catch me on Discord at tz#3983 -- we can discuss collaboration.
